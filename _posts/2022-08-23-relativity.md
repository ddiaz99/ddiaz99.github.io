In 1905 Albert Einstein published what would become known as the theory of special relativity in a paper entitled "**Zur Elektrodynamik bewegter KÃ¶rper**", and later, in 1915, he published the theory of general relativity, perhaps the most beautiful theory of how the universe works on large scales. I have always wanted to understand relativity, and that is why I started this blog. First we will study special relativity from Minkowski spacetime, it was in 1908 when Minkowski realized that special relativity could be better understood from this geometrical point of view.

In the following $$V$$ will be a $$4$$-dimensional $$R$$-vector space. Let $$c\in R$$ be the speed of light, and choose a basis $$e=(e_{1},e_{2},e_{3},e_{4})$$ of $$V$$. Define a scalar product (*Minkowski scalar product*) on $$V$$ for two vectors $$u=x_{1}e_{1}+y_{1}e_{2}+z_{1}e_{3}+t_{1}e_{4}$$ and $$v=x_{2}e_{1}+y_{2}e_{2}+z_{2}e_{3}+t_{2}e_{4}$$ by:

$$
\left<  u,v \right> _{e} := x_{1}x_{2} + y_{1}y_{2} + z_{1}z_{2} - c^{2}t_{1}t_{2}
$$

A $$4$$-dimensional vector space $V$ on which a Minkowski scalar product is defined is called a *Minkowski space* (or spacetime).
