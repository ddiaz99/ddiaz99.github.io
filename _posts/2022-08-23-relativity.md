In 1905, Albert Einstein published his groundbreaking theory of special relativity in a paper titled **Zur Elektrodynamik bewegter KÃ¶rper**. A decade later, in 1915, he presented his theory of general relativity, widely regarded as one of the most exquisite explanations of how the universe operates on a large scale. Understanding relativity has always been a personal interest of mine, which is why I began this blog. Initially, we'll explore special relativity through the lens of Minkowski spacetime. In 1908, Minkowski realized that this geometrical perspective provided a better understanding of special relativity.

In the following $$V$$ will be a $$4$$-dimensional $$R$$-vector space. Let $$c\in R$$ be the speed of light, and choose a basis $$e=(e_{1},e_{2},e_{3},e_{4})$$ of $$V$$. Define a scalar product (*Minkowski scalar product*) on $$V$$ for two vectors $$u=x_{1}e_{1}+y_{1}e_{2}+z_{1}e_{3}+t_{1}e_{4}$$ and $$v=x_{2}e_{1}+y_{2}e_{2}+z_{2}e_{3}+t_{2}e_{4}$$ by:

$$
\left<  u,v \right> _{e} := x_{1}x_{2} + y_{1}y_{2} + z_{1}z_{2} - c^{2}t_{1}t_{2}
$$

A $$4$$-dimensional vector space $$V$$ on which a Minkowski scalar product is defined is called a **Minkowski space (or spacetime)**.
