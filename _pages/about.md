I am from Colombia. I obtained Bachelor's degrees in mathematics and electronic engineer. I am interested in Algebra, in particular Representation Theory and its interactions with Lie Theory, Number Theory, and Mathematical Physics. During my undergraduate degrees I was supervised by Dr. <a href="https://alfredorestrepo.academia.edu/" target="_blank">Alfredo Restrepo Palacios</a> and Dr. <a href="https://scholar.google.es/citations?hl=es&user=Pcs9Vv0AAAAJ" target="_blank">Jesús Alonso Ochoa Arango</a>.

I am passionate about music, writing songs and playing guitar. You can find a song of my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40daV-R6fv8&ab_channel=HeathartProductions%26Records" target="_blank">here</a>.

I believe in Federico Ardila's axioms:
- Axiom 1: Mathematical potential is equally present in different groups, irrespective of geographic, demographic, and economic boundaries.
- Axiom 2: Everyone can have joyful, meaningful, and empowering mathematical experiences.
- Axiom 3: Mathematics is a powerful, malleable tool that can be shaped and used differently by various communities to serve their needs.
- Axiom 4: Every student deserves to be treated with dignity and respect.
