I am an electronic engineer and mathematics student interested in computer science and applied mathematics, specifically in statistical learning, computational algebraic geometry and combinatorics. I am also a member of the Analysis, PDE's and Applications research group, where we specialize in Control Theory. During my undergraduate degrees I was supervised by Dr. <a href="https://alfredorestrepo.academia.edu/" target="_blank">Alfredo Restrepo Palacios</a> and Dr. <a href="https://scholar.google.es/citations?hl=es&user=Pcs9Vv0AAAAJ" target="_blank">Jesús Alonso Ochoa Arango</a>.

I am passionate about music, writing songs and playing guitar.
