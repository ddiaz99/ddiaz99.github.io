I am an electronic engineer and mathematics student interested in machine learning, data science and its interactions with topology, differential geometry and optimization. I was supervised by Dr. <a href="https://alfredorestrepo.academia.edu/" target="_blank">Alfredo Restrepo Palacios</a> and Dr. <a href="https://scholar.google.es/citations?hl=es&user=Pcs9Vv0AAAAJ" target="_blank">Jesús Alonso Ochoa Arango</a>.
