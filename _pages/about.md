I am an electronic engineer and mathematics student interested in applied mathematics, specifically in statistical learning theory, information theory and computational algebraic topology. I am also a member of the Analysis, PDE's and Applications research group, where we specialize in Control Theory. During my undergraduate degrees I was supervised by Dr. <a href="https://alfredorestrepo.academia.edu/" target="_blank">Alfredo Restrepo Palacios</a> and Dr. <a href="https://scholar.google.es/citations?hl=es&user=Pcs9Vv0AAAAJ" target="_blank">Jesús Alonso Ochoa Arango</a>.

I am passionate about music, writing songs and playing guitar.

    Do mathematics only if you are passionate about it, only if you would do it even if you had to find the time for it after a full day's of work in another job. Like poetry and music, mathematics is not an occupation but a vocation.

I believe in Federico Ardila's axioms:
- Axiom 1: Mathematical potential is equally present in different groups, irrespective of geographic, demographic, and economic boundaries.
- Axiom 2: Everyone can have joyful, meaningful, and empowering mathematical experiences.
- Axiom 3: Mathematics is a powerful, malleable tool that can be shaped and used differently by various communities to serve their needs.
- Axiom 4: Every student deserves to be treated with dignity and respect.
