I am an electronic engineer and mathematics student interested in applied mathematics, specifically in statistical learning theory, information theory and computational algebraic topology. I am also a member of the Analysis, PDE's and Applications research group, where we specialize in Control Theory. During my undergraduate degrees I was supervised by Dr. <a href="https://alfredorestrepo.academia.edu/" target="_blank">Alfredo Restrepo Palacios</a> and Dr. <a href="https://scholar.google.es/citations?hl=es&user=Pcs9Vv0AAAAJ" target="_blank">Jesús Alonso Ochoa Arango</a>.

I am passionate about music, writing songs and playing guitar.

The mathematician’s patterns, like the painter’s or the poet’s must be beautiful; the ideas, like the colors or the words must fit together in a harmonious way.

I believe in Federico Ardila's axioms:
- Axiom 1: Mathematical potential is equally present in different groups, irrespective of geographic, demographic, and economic boundaries.
- Axiom 2: Everyone can have joyful, meaningful, and empowering mathematical experiences.
- Axiom 3: Mathematics is a powerful, malleable tool that can be shaped and used differently by various communities to serve their needs.
- Axiom 4: Every student deserves to be treated with dignity and respect.
